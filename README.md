# Maybelline Products

## Project Philosophy
I have always been interested in makeup but never had someone to teach me how to use it. This project stemmed from the idea of wanting to get many people's reviews on different makeup products so individuals could learn more about them. It was designed for people to see what products different brands offered and if they were any good. 

## Details
For this project it focuses on one specific brand: "Maybelline." The website outlines each of their products by identifying the name, a description of the product, and an image to view what it looks like. The data is grabs using a fetch from an APi extentsion: https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products.json?brand=maybelline. It then filters through the API and adds the products info into cards uploaded onto the page. 

## Features
1. Can enlarge image by moving your mouse over it.
2. Can leave comments on specific products.
3. Can heart products that you enjoy.
4. Has a link that can take you to the bottom of the page to see all the comments.
5. Gives you information on each product.


## How to Use
This page is pretty simple to use. At the top of the page there is a link that will take you to the comment section at the bottom. All you need to do is click on this link and it will take you directly to those comments for you to see. To make a comment you simply find the product you want to comment on, type your comment in the input box, and when you are finished submit the box. You will then be alerted that your comment has been moved to the bottom of the page. To move past the alert on your screen you must click the "okay" button. 

On each card of data there is also a heart. If you click the heart it will turn red and show that you like this particular product. If you move your mouse over the heart the outline will turn red. This allows the users to know that it is something that can be clicked on. 

The other item that changes when you hover over it is the pictures. When you move your mouse over the pictures they will increase in size. This allows you to see them better. When you move the mouse away the picture returns to its regular size. This allows you to easily peruse the rest of the site without the picture getting in the way. 

## Installation Instructions
In order to upload this website for your own benefits you can go to the github link: https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-1-javascript-project-mode. There you can click on the code button and this will give you some information. If you then click on the SSH tab you can copy the link. 

Once you copy the link you can then go to your terminal and type: "git clone" then paste the link and push enter. This will copy the site to your own page. You can then type in the terminal "open index.html" to bring up the website.
