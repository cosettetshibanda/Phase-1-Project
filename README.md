# Maybelline Products

## Project Philosophy
I have always been interested in makeup but never had someone to teach me how to use it. This project stemmed from the idea of wanting to get many people's reviews on different makeup products so individuals could learn more about them. It was designed for people to see what products different brands offered and if they were any good. 

## Details
For this project it focuses on one specific brand: "Maybelline." It outlines each of their products by identifying the name, a description of the product, and an image to view what it looks like. It grabs all the information from an APi extentsion:
